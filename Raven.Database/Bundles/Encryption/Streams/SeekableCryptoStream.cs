	/// <summary>
	/// Wraps a FileStream (or other seekable stream) with an encryptor and decryptor.
	/// This is like a Seekable CryptoStream.
	/// 
	/// The file format is as follows:
	/// Header:
	///		- Magic: A UInt64 magic number to recognize that this is indeed an encrypted stream.
	///		- IV: An Int32 for IV size in bytes
	///		- BlockSize: An Int32 for unencrypted block size in bytes.
	///		- EncryptedBlockSize: An Int32 for encrypted block size in bytes.
	///	Block:
	///		- BlockIV: byte[], Length == Header.IV
	///		- Data: byte[], Length == Header.BlockSize
	/// Footer:
	///		- Length: After the last block, an Int64 length is written. This is the total length of the file.
	///				  the length is required, because the blocks are of an all identical size. If the file ends
	///				  in the middle of a block, this length will be used to truncate that block after decryption.
	/// </summary>
